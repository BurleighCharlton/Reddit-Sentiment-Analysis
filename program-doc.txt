Outline of program control flow:

Program segments:

Filesys:
Utility to handle however we decide to set up our filesystem for data. 

Reddit checking:
Utility to iterate over all comments made on a post that were made within
a given period of the post being made and that can be associated with one or
more tickers. 
24 or 36 hours seems like a decent default period. 
We save all comments under a ticker they are associated with along with the
date of the post. 

SA:
Run SA on Reddit data before saving it

Stock checking:
Seperate utility from the reddit one. Takes data from the reddit utility
and finds data for stocks in the week following that data. Looks for
correlation. We can figure this out once the reddit part is working.
